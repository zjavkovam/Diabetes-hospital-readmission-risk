Predicting Readmission Risk 

This project aims to predict readmission risk and the number of diagnoses based on clinical data from 130 U.S. hospitals (1999-2008). The dataset includes over 50 features representing patient demographics, hospital outcomes, and medical history.

Part 1: Readmission Risk Prediction
We experiment with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes models to predict the risk of patient readmission, exploring the impact of various features on model performance.
Part 2: Diagnosis Count Prediction
For predicting the number of diagnoses, we apply regularized regression methods, including Lasso and Ridge regression (which are types of regression that help prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients). We investigate how different features influence the regression results.
The dataset contains critical patient attributes such as age, gender, medical history, lab results, and hospital visit data, providing valuable insights for improving clinical outcomes.
